Kanban Task Management System

This project is a simple Kanban-style Task Management Application built for organizing and tracking tasks.  
It allows users to create, update, and move tasks between different workflow stages (e.g., *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Done*).  

I developed this as a learning project to improve my web development skills and understand modern frontend frameworks.
